## Steganography task

Text is saved inside an image using steghide.
Copy the contents of steg_alias.sh to ~/.bashrc (or) sudo cat steg_alias.sh >> ~/.bashrc

Enter 'hide' to hide text in an image, and 'retrieve' to retrieve it.


Status:
Although this application involves usage of an external library, it is quite efficient, and moderately secure.

Another method using conversion of text into binary numbers and changing the pixel values of the image according to a code is still in progress.
( I was finding difficulty with conversion of values between different systems and manipulating the pixel values of the image.)
